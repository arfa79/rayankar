2. Document your solution

## Requirements and Step


1. Setup a Kubernetes cluster on a single node (CP + Worker) using Kubespray
2. Create a Helm Chart that bootstraps a WordPress application with MySQL and PhpMyAdmin ingress

## Nice to do

1. Create a Terraform script for the Kubernetes cluster
2. Create a CI/CD Azure Pipeline in YAML format in the root project.

## Delivery
1. You will be given a VPS running Ubuntu 22, you must be able to deploy with the single command line on this VPS.
2. You must plan your code in such a way that if we erase the VPS and start over, we must arrive at the same state that you intended.
3. Must have a single execution script/file that we can bootstrap and review your result in a clean Ubuntu server in our environment
4. Clone/copy this repository into a new GitHub repository and add your result, then share the result with user: `mason-chase` on GitHub in private mode.
5. We must be able to navigate to `https://candidate-name.maxtld.dev/dbadmin` and observe PhpMyAdmin UI and it must work
6. WordPress must be available at `https://candidate-name.maxtld.dev/wordpress`
